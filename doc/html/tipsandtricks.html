<h2>Dispatching new jobs to workers without new code</h2>

<p>The other day I found myself in a position in which I needed to delete a few
thousand records. The tough part of this situation is that I needed to ensure
the ActiveRecord callbacks were made on these objects thus making a simple SQL
statement unfeasible. Also, I didn't want to wait all day to select and destroy
these objects. Queue Classic to the rescue! (no pun intended)</p>

<p>The API of Queue Classic enables you to quickly dispatch jobs to workers. In my
case I wanted to call <code>Invoice.destroy(id)</code> a few thousand times. I fired up a
heroku console session and executed this line:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">  Invoice.find(:all, :select =&gt; &quot;id&quot;, :conditions =&gt; &quot;some condition&quot;).map {|i| QC.enqueue(&quot;Invoice.destroy&quot;, i.id) }
</code></pre>

<p>With the help of 20 workers I was able to destroy all of these records
(preserving their callbacks) in a few minutes.</p>
