<h1>Scheduling Jobs</h1>

<p>Many popular queueing solution provide support for scheduling. Features like
Redis-Scheduler and the run<em>at column in DJ are very important to the web
application developer. While queue</em>classic does not offer any sort of scheduling
features, I do not discount the importance of the concept. However, it is my
belief that a scheduler has no place in a queueing library, to that end I will
show you how to schedule jobs using queue_classic and the clockwork gem.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In this example, we are working with a system that needs to compute a sales
summary at the end of each day. Lets say that we need to compute a summary for
each sales employee in the system.</p>

<p>Instead of enqueueing jobs with run_at set to 24hour intervals,
we will define a clock process to enqueue the jobs at a specified
time on each day. Let us create a file and call it clock.rb:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
  handler {|job| QC.enqueue(job)}
  every(1.day, &quot;SalesSummaryGenerator.build_daily_report&quot;, :at =&gt; &quot;01:00&quot;)

</code></pre>

<p>To start our scheduler, we will use the clockwork bin:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">  $ clockwork clock.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Now each day at 01:00 we will be sending the build<em>daily</em>report message to our
SalesSummaryGenerator class.</p>

<p>I found this abstraction quite powerful and easy to understand. Like
queue_classic, the clockwork gem is simple to understand and has 0 dependencies.
In production, I create a heroku process type called clock. This is typically
what my Procfile looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">worker: rake jobs:work
clock: clockwork clock.rb
</code></pre>
