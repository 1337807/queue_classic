<h1>Scheduling Jobs</h1>

<p>Many popular queueing solution provide support for scheduling. Features like
Redis-Scheduler,the run_at column in DJ are very important to the web
application developer. While Queue Classic does not offer any sort of scheduling
features, I do not discount the importance of the concept. However, it is my
belief that a scheduler has no place in a queueing library, to that end I will
show you how to schedule jobs using Queue Classic and the Clockwork gem.</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>In this example, we are working with a system that needs to compute a sales
summary at the end of each day. Lets say that we need to compute a summary for
each sales employee in the system.</p>

<p>Instead of enqueueing jobs with run_at set to 24hour intervals,
we will define a clock process to enqueue the jobs at a specified
time on each day.</p>

<p>Create a file and call it clock.rb</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
  handler {|job| QC.enqueue(job)}
  every(1.day, &quot;SalesSummaryGenerator.build_daily_report&quot;, :at =&gt; &quot;01:00&quot;)

</code></pre>
